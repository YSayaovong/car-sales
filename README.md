# Car Sales Analysis Project

This repository contains a data engineering project analyzing car sales data. The project focuses on data cleaning, transformation, and exploratory data analysis (EDA) to uncover insights into car sales trends, pricing, and vehicle characteristics.

## Project Overview

The Car Sales Analysis project aims to:
- Clean and transform raw car sales data.
- Explore car sales trends by make, color, mileage, and price.
- Create visualizations to enhance understanding of the data.
- Export the cleaned and transformed dataset for further use.

## Dataset

The dataset contains the following columns:
- `Make`: Car brand or manufacturer.
- `Colour`: Car color.
- `Doors`: Number of doors.
- `Price`: Price of the car (in dollars).

The raw data required cleaning and transformation to prepare it for analysis.

## Project Structure

- **Data Import**: Load the car sales dataset for analysis.
- **Data Cleaning**: Remove unwanted characters in the `Price` column, convert data types, and handle any missing values.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Analyze car makes, color distribution, price range, and mileage impact on price.
- **Data Export**: Save the cleaned and transformed data for future use.
